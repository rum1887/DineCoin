# DineCoin

Just a step away from revolutionzing the way people dine out. We aim to create a community of food lovers who can share their experiences, discover new restaurants, and earn rewards for doing so.

### Description

An app that allows users to upload their restaurant visits and food orders, along with their bill, in exchange for virtual coins. These coins can be used to claim offers available within the app. 

Restaurants can also pay to view the data submitted by the users, allowing them to gather insights into customer behavior and preferences.

Users can earn rewards for sharing their dining experiences, while restaurants can gain valuable data that can help them improve their menus and customer service. 

Furthermore, the app provides a convenient platform for users to track their dining habits, while also helping them save money on future restaurant visits.
